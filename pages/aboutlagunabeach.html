                If you answered <strong>Yes</strong> to any of the questions above, then I recommend you give Laguna Beach, California a visit.

                There <strong>are</strong> warmer places one can go in the US for a winter getaway. Many places in Florida have a more beach centric <em>subtropical feel</em>, but the almost perfect coastal weather and topographical setting of Laguna Beach makes it more more than just a sandy beach setting.

                This is not to say that Laguna Beach has ideal beach season weather all winter long. Southern California has its occasional nights from December through February where the local residents pull out their furs and practically declare a state of emergency because low temperature may dip into the upper 30's for a night or two, but such emergency measures for such mild temperatures are actually a source of amusement to visitors from other parts of the country

                Best time to visit Laguna Beach
            </h3>
            <p class="about-pmargins">
                Despite the mild winter-free climate where the average temperature varies only 16 degrees from a low of 64 in December/January to a high of 80 in September, there are some great and some not so great times to visit Laguna Beach.<br/>

            </p>
            <p class="about-pmargins">
                <strong>December/January/February</strong> - can be beautiful, especially compared to other parts of the country, sometimes you may even have summer-like day(s) in the upper 80's, but the sun sets in Laguna as early as most other parts of the country, and the sun loses much of its warmth by 3 PM due to offshore breezes coming in off the ocean. One of the big pluses of a January visit is that the sunsets over Catalina Island in the distance are beautiful during that period. It's probably not best to take a chance on the weather during these months, unless you don't mind occasional days with highs in the 50's.
            </p>
            <p class="about-pmargins">
                <strong>March/April</strong> - I consider these two months to be among the best times to visit Laguna Beach, especially in a year where winter refuses to realize it's time to get up and go. Because the sun is stonger and the days are longer during these months, you won't feel cold on the beach until at least 5 PM. You can have days where highs are in the 50's, but if the sun is shining, which it almost always is, you'll feel 20 degrees warmer. Sunsets are not as glorious during these months because the sun is no longer setting over Catalina Island, but with the sun setting later during these months, you'll probably be in the midst of your evening plans by that time anyway. Best time to plan your visit is to arrive in mid March, call it a late winter getaway.
            </p>
            <p class="about-pmargins">
                <strong>May/June</strong> - This is a time when the rest of the country has finally broken out of the icy grip of winter, so for that reason, but not that reason alone, it's not exactly the best time of the year to visit Laguna Beach. Southern California often experiences a period known as 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Gloom" target="_blank">"June Gloom"</a>, and another less frequently used term is "May Gray". This is a time of year often characterized by cloudy overcast skies often accompanied by fog and drizzle, and these conditions can persist for days on end. Sometimes southern California doesn't experience this weather phenomenon, but why take the chance that it will just when the rest of the country is finally warming and brightening up?
            </p>
            <p class="about-pmargins">
                <strong>July/August</strong> - Sometimes "June Gloom" can persist into the months of July and August, although that tends to be quite rare. The summer months of 2010 were reportedly persistently overcast in July and August, but when the weather is nice during the summer months, the traffic into and out of Laguna Beach is very heavy (on nice days), parking can be difficult to find, and hotel rates are at their peak. Furthermore, since every part of the country is experiencing summer during these months, there's no real reason to "get away" by going to Laguna Beach at this time.
            </p>
            <p class="about-pmargins">
                <strong>September/October/November</strong> - Some days during these months are the hottest of the entire year, sometimes due to the phenomenon known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Gloom" target="_blank">"Santa Ana winds"</a>. It is generally a good time of year to go, the local crowds have thinned out substantially, although hotels sometimes hold out and only drop their rates <strong>after</strong> September 30th, but if you'd like to experience the last gasp of summer and don't mind missing the fall foliage in other parts of the country, then this can be an almost ideal time to visit Laguna Beach. I prefer October over November because by early November daylight savings time is finished and the sun will start setting around 5 PM after turning the clocks back, but there generally is still plenty of summer-like warmth to enjoy in November if you don't mind the shorter days.
