        <h1>About Laguna Beach</h1>
        <h2>An <em>almost</em> winter-free getaway</h2>
        <hr><br/><br/><br/>
        <p>If you're like me and you start dreading the oncoming winter as soon as the date of the summer solstice (after which the days begin to subtly shorten), and you want to visit a place that has ocean views, nearby hills and mountains, generally blue skies, and for which a "terrible" winter day is to have a rare low temperature in the 30's and a high in the 50's, and is even close enough to places that can have winter weather, then I recommend you give Laguna Beach, CA a try.</p>
        <p>True, there are warmer places one can go, more beachy <em>tropical drink style</em> resort settings, but the nearly ideal coastal weather and topographical setting of Laguna Beach make it nearly ideal for a visit during cooler months.</p>
        <p>This is not to say that Laguna Beach has ideal beachgoing weather every month of the year. Southern California has its occasional nights from December through February where the local residents pull out their furs and practically declare a state of emergency because the lows dip into the upper 30's, but such emergency measures can be a source of entertainment to people from other sections of the country. </p>
